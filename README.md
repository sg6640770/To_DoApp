Project Title: To-Do Application with API Integration.

Overview: Enhance the basic To-Do application by integrating external API data, implementing advanced state management using Redux, and ensuring the application is responsive and user-friendly across different devices.

Features:
1. Frontend Development And API Integration:
>Utilize HTML to structure the application's layout.
>Use CSS for styling the application. Feel free to use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI for design components.
>Implement the application logic using JavaScript (ES6 or later).
>Integrate with a public API (e.g., a weather API) to display data relevant to the tasks. For example, if a task is related to an outdoor activity, show the current weather conditions.
>Implement error handling for the API requests to manage and display errors gracefully in the UI.

2.React Components And Advanced State Management::
>Develop the application using functional components and demonstrate the use of React hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`).
>The application should have at least two components:    
>TaskInput: A component for adding a new task.
>TaskList: A component for displaying the list of tasks.
>Use Redux Thunk or Redux Saga for handling asynchronous actions (e.g., API calls).
>Use Redux Thunk or Redux Saga for handling asynchronous actions (e.g., API calls).



3.Responsive Design: 
>Ensure the application is fully responsive and provides an excellent user experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use CSS Grid and Flexbox to achieve responsiveness.
>Implement a mobile-first design approach..


4.Functionality:
>Add Task: Users should be able to input a task into a text field and add it to the list by pressing a button or pressing Enter.
>View Tasks: Display all added tasks in a list format.
>Delete Task: Each task should have a delete button that, when clicked, removes the task from the list.
>Task Prioritization: Allow users to set priorities for tasks (e.g., High, Medium, Low) and display them accordingly.
>Persistent Storage: Use local storage or session storage to save tasks and authentication status, ensuring data persistence across browser sessions.

5.User Authentication:
>Add a simple user authentication feature (login/logout functionality) that simulates the process using Redux for state management. There's no need to integrate with a backend; you can mock the authentication process.
>Protect the To-Do list behind authentication, ensuring that tasks are only visible to logged-in users.


Setup Instructions: 

1.Install Git:
>If you don't have Git installed, download and install it.

2.Create a GitHub Repository:
>Go to GitHub and sign in.
>Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository".
>Fill in the repository name, description, and choose whether it will be public or private.
>Click "Create repository".

3.Clone the Repository:
>Open your terminal or command prompt.
>Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

4.Run the following command to clone the repository:
>Run this command on terminal : git clone <repository_url>
>Replace <repository_url> with the URL of your GitHub repository.

5.Navigate to the Repository Directory:
>Change to the directory of the cloned repository:
>Run this command on terminal : cd <repository_name>
>Run this command on terminal : Replace <repository_name> with the name of your

Running Instructions: 
>Run this command on terminal : npm install
>Run this command on terminal : npm run dev
